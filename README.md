The Image Scanning Project is a sorting system for radiology images of hands, and uses recursive neural network (CNN) algorithms. The main goal is to determine whether the hand on the image is healthy or broken.

Project phases include:
1. **Data collection and processing:**
     Collecting various images of hands from different sources and preparing the data to improve the quality of training.

2. **Training CNN models:**
     Using CNN algorithms to train the classification on the collected data, enabling the system to recognize the distinctive numbers of healthy and broken hands.

3. **Performance evaluation:**
     Measuring correlations leads using a test set of images to confirm classification and its ability to differentiate between different cases.

4. **Documentation and publication:**
     Preparing detailed documentation and explanations on how to use and operate the project. Code and models are published on GitHub to facilitate cross-collaboration.

5. **Future improvements:**
     The possibility of ensuring a comprehensive classification that does not include the general, in addition to exploring opportunities to integrate other technologies or reach the application scope.

Presents a technical project to improve medical image classification using CNN, and encourages participation and engagement from the programming community via GitHub.
